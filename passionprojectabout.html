  <h1>PASSION PROJECT :: ABOUT</h1>
    <p>This project is all about my two favorite things: coffee shops/cafes and my home, the Mitten... Otherwise known as Michigan. I've always loved visiting coffee shops and enjoying their ambiance, whether I'm working on homework or visiting with old friends, nothing is more comforting than a nice cup of coffee and comforting place. </p>
  <p>Here I will be sharing my favorite spots around the Mitten to caffeinate at. Drinks, treats, local spots nearby, I'll be sharing them all. </p>
